# NSMTrack
 
The inofficial repository containing the machine learning tools used in our in-house nanofluidic scattering microscopy setup, introduced in "Label-Free Nanofluidic Scattering Microscopy of Size and Mass of Single Diffusing Molecules and Nanoparticles".

To demo the software, please follow the instructions found in "Instructions for Demo.txt". 

To train your own trajectory tracking models, run "train cGAN.ipynb".
